At least listener of the

StateNotifier Instance of

'SceneController' threw an exception

when the notifier tried to update its state.

The exceptions thrown are:

Tried to modify a provider while the widget tree was building. If you are encountering this error, chances are you tried to modify a provider

in a widget life-cycle, such as

but not limited to:

build

initState

dispose

didUpdateWidget

didChangeDependencies

Modifying a provider inside those life-cycles is not allowed, as it could

lead to an inconsistent UI state. For example, two widgets could

listen to the

same provider, but incorrectly receive different states.

To fix this problem, you have one of two solutions:

(preferred) Move the logic for modifying your provider outside of a widget

life-cycle. For example, maybe you could update your provider inside a button's

onPressed instead.

Delay your modification, such as by encapsulating the modification

in a `Future(() {...})`. This will perform your update after the widget tree is done building.
